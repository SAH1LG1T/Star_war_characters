# Star_war_characters
A project (UI Based only and dummy API) to view star wars movie characters data in readable and card format
I have used Starwars Api (SWAPI) to get the characters data 
used React,Typescript and TAilwind css for styling part 

I have used eye_color inside each character's info as i dont get the actual idea to get the color the species as it was a empty property in most of the cases
I know that the UI can be improved bt for now i have designed it like what I felt was right

Also added the search bar at the last that was also not much good with the Design POV bt it is working and placenment we can do it later for good looks
this time focused on fucntionality part, naming conventions and good coding practices


# 🌌 Star Wars Characters

A simple **UI-based project** that displays Star Wars movie characters’ data in a clean card format using the [Star Wars API (SWAPI)](https://swapi.dev/).  
This project focuses on **frontend implementation**, **data handling**, and **clean coding practices**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Displays **Star Wars characters** with details like name, height, weight, birth year, and more.  
- Used **eye_color** to give each character card a unique background tint  
  (since the `species` field was empty for most characters).  
- Added a **search bar** to find characters by name.  
  - The design is simple for now — the focus was mainly on **functionality** and **code structure**.
- Fully responsive layout using **Tailwind CSS grid**.
- Follows **good naming conventions** and **component-based architecture**.

> 💬 “I designed it the way I felt was right for now — focusing on functionality first.”
